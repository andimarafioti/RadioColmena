# RadioColmena


Desireded Functionalities for initial release
==============

- Stream the radio
- Show a notification while the user is streaming
- Link to social media
- Show what's on today.

Current issues for the streaming of the radio
--------------

- Unable to distinguish why the stream fails, when it fails. There is two known option: 1. The user is not properly conected to the internet, 2. The stream is offline (sometimes altogether, others just the stream for android).
- It would be nice to add an 'online' alert so the user can know if the streaming will work. I thought of running a pre-stream when the app first opens but this takes too much time.

Current issues for the design of the app
--------------

- There's no handling for bigger screens (looks weird on tablets)
- There's no background. Looks neat but empty.
- Too much space! Need fillings to get feelings.


Desireded Functionalities for future releases
--------------

- Show wether or not the android stream is online.
- Fix the android stream (*not really on the scope of the app*)
- Show what's on now.
- Link to the descriptions of the shows.
- Link to social media for the shows.
